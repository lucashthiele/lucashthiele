Hi, I'm Lucas.

I'm a backend developer passionate about building scalable and reliable systems.
My main focus is on Go, C#, and Java, but I also experiment with others web technologies.

I enjoy:
- Designing APIs and backend services
- Working with distributed systems
- Automating workflows and processes

Currently, I'm working on Routine Revo, a web/mobile app that will revolutionize your gym routines. 
See my repositories below to get a glimpse of what I'm doing.
